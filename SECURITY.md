# Security Policy for Shiksha Dost Backend

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the Shiksha Dost Backend repository. It is designed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application and its data.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, please report it immediately by contacting the maintainers at [contact@shikshadost.com](mailto:contact@shikshadost.com). Please include the following details in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Suggested fixes or mitigation strategies if applicable.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for addressing the issue.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- **Sensitive Data**: Ensure that sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets are stored in environment variables and not hardcoded in the codebase.
- **`.env` File**: Use the `.env` file to manage environment variables locally, but ensure it is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
- **Dotenv Configuration**: The `dotenvConfig.js` file in the `src/config/` directory is used to load environment variables. Ensure this file is properly configured and secure.

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Auth Middleware**: The `authMiddleware.js` in the `src/middlewares/` directory is responsible for handling authentication. Ensure that all routes requiring authentication are properly protected.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.
- **Password Hashing**: Ensure that user passwords are hashed using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing them in the database.

### 3. **Data Validation and Sanitization**
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize user inputs to remove any potentially harmful content.

### 4. **Database Security**
- **Connection Security**: Ensure that the database connection in `src/db/connect.js` uses secure protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) and that credentials are not exposed.
- **Query Parameterization**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Error Middleware**: The `errorMiddleware.js` in the `src/middlewares/` directory should be used to handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information.
- **Logging**: Use the `logger.js` and `requestLogger.js` in the `src/utils/` directory to log errors and requests for auditing purposes.

### 6. **Dependency Management**
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update dependencies listed in `package.json` to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.
- **Security Audits**: Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 7. **API Security**
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- **CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly to restrict access to the API from unauthorized domains.

### 8. **File Uploads**
- **File Validation**: Validate file types and sizes before accepting uploads.
- **Secure Storage**: Store uploaded files in a secure location (e.g., AWS S3) and ensure that access is restricted.

### 9. **Email Security**
- **Email Templates**: Ensure that email templates in the `src/template/` directory do not contain sensitive information.
- **Email Sending**: Use secure protocols (e.g., SMTP over TLS) when sending emails.

### 10. **Deployment Security**
- **Docker Security**: Ensure that the `Dockerfile` and `scripts/_Docker.sh` are configured securely, and that the container is run with the least privileges necessary.
- **CI/CD Security**: The `Deploy-Backend.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory should be configured securely, with secrets managed properly and not exposed in logs.

## Regular Security Audits

- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix security issues.
- **Penetration Testing**: Perform periodic penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the application.
- **Security Training**: Ensure that all developers are trained in secure coding practices.

## Incident Response

In the event of a security breach, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Identification**: Identify the scope and impact of the breach.
2. **Containment**: Contain the breach to prevent further damage.
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the breach.
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations and ensure that the breach cannot reoccur.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and improve security measures.
